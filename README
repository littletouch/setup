The Setup is a website with nerdy interviews asking people what they use to get the job done. It's a simple static little thing, pushed out via Jekyll and rsync.

Interested in cloning the site for your own interviews, similar or otherwise? DO IT! These are the questions I email people:

    1) Who are you, and what do you do? (Try to keep this brief!)
    2) What hardware are you using?
    3) And what software?
    4) What would be your dream setup?

If you *do* make your own version, send me a note so I can check it out.

Love,
